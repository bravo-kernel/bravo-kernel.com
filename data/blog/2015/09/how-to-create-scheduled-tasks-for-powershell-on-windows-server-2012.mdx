Properly configured Scheduled Tasks for Powershell scripts on Windows Server 2012.

## Creating the service account

Assuming the account only requires local administrator permissions:

- Open the Local Users and Groups console (``lusrmgr.msc``)
- Create a new local user (service) account used to execute the scheduled task
- Add the service account to the local Administrators group
- Open the Local Security console (``gepdit.msc``) and expand:
  - Local Computer Policy
  - Windows Settings
  - Security Settings
  - Local Policies
  - User Rights Assignment
- Open the ``Log on as a service`` policy and make sure to add the service account

## Creating the Scheduled Task

Open the Task Scheduler console (``taskschd.msc``) and create a new task.

### General tab

- Use a meaningful name
- Specify your service account using the ``Change User or Group`` button
- Select ``Run whether user user is logged in or not``
- Select the ``hidden`` option
- Set the ``Configure for`` option to Windows Server 2012

### Triggers tab

Create two triggers:

- One using begin ``At startup`` so the scheduled task will survive reboots
- One using begin ``At task creation/modification`` so it will run from the moment the task is created

Make sure both triggers share the same configuration:

- Select ``Repeat task at every`` and set to e.g. 30 minutes
- Change the duration to ``Indefinitely``
- Be proactive; stop the task if it runs longer than ``1 hour``
- Select the ``Enabled`` checkbox

### Actions tab

Create a new action:

- Select ``Start a program``
- Set the ``Program/script`` field to (just) ``Powershell``
- Set the ``Arguments`` field to ``-noprofile -executionpolicy bypass -file "c:\your-script.ps1"``
- Even though this is optional it would be wise to fill the ``Start in (optional)``
field with the full path of the directory your script is located in

> **Note:** do NOT use the ``-noexit`` argument as this will keep your task running
> indefinitely, preventing it to reach ``Ready`` state after completion.

### Conditions tab

Nothing to do here

### Settings tab

Make sure to set the bottom most dropdown to ``Stop the existing instance``.

## Round up

On saving the task it will:

- Start immediately (status ``Running``)
- Change to status ``Queued`` after it has completed
- Will be executed again every other 30 minutes
