I was getting flooded with error emails on my Debian 6 server running on a hosted VPS:

```
Subject: info: mpt raid status change on dev01

This is a RAID status update from mpt-statusd.  The mpt-status program reports that one of the RAIDs changed state:
```

Since I'm not using RAID... running this as root will stop the emails:

```
# /etc/init.d/mpt-statusd stop
# echo RUNDAEMON=no > /etc/default/mpt-statusd
```

As an alternative to step 2: use package rcconf  to deactivate this service on startup in all runlevel.
