Step-by-step instructions for creating Github Releases like the pros.

Assuming:

- A ``master`` branch
- A more-or-less stable ``dev`` branch ready to be merged into master
- A ``VERSION.txt`` file holding release version

**Pro Tip:** keep release cycles short, release often!

## Creating the release

1. Create ``VERSION.txt`` in your dev branch and fill it with the release number (e.g. 1.0-alpha1)
2. Merge the master branch into dev
3. Merge the dev branch back into master
4. Go to the Github page holding your project and:
    - Select <em>releases</em>
    - Select <em>Draft a new release</em>
    - Fill in 1.0-alpha1 as the <em>Tag version</em> 
    - Target the master branch
    - Doublecheck before pressing the "Publish release" button

That's all there's too it, your first release. 

> **Note:** to prevent future merge conflicts caused by e.g. bugfixes... regularly merge master into dev!

## Starting work on the next release

Now that the release is out, it's time to start work on the next one

1. Update ``VERSION.txt`` in the dev branch with the next release number (e.g. 1.0-alpha2)
2. Commit and push change to dev
3. Add features to your dev branch

Once you are ready to publish a new release... simply restart ``Creating the release`` but skip step 1.
