In this follow-up post to
[How to build a CakePHP 3 REST API in minutes](/blog/2015/04/how-to-build-a-cakephp-3-rest-api-in-minutes/)
we  explore the inner workings of our new API.

[![Run in Postman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)](https://app.getpostman.com/run-collection/197398a609a6d233a8c2)

We will address the most common use cases by:

1. Adding some tasty cocktail data to our application
(already listening at ``http://cake3api.app``)
2. Accessing the cocktail resources through our API using the:
    - Index action (GET)
    - View action (GET)
    - Add action (POST)
    - Edit/update action (PUT)
    - Delete action (DELETE)
3. Configuring Pagination
4. Testing Querystring Parameters

Before starting this tutorial either:

- Complete the previous post
- Start fresh by using these
[end-state application sources](https://github.com/bravo-kernel/application-examples/tree/master/blog-how-to-build-a-cakephp3-rest-api),
composer installing and running the database migration

## 1. Adding The Cocktails

### Populate the database

Download this CakePHP
[database migration file](https://github.com/bravo-kernel/application-examples/blob/master/blog-how-to-use-a-cakephp3-rest-api/config/Migrations/20150411161731_initial.php)
to your ``config/Migrations`` directory.

Now run the following command inside your application's root directory to
create and popuplate the ``cocktails`` table:

```bash
bin/cake migrations migrate
```

### Create the controller

Create a new file named ``src/Controller/CocktailsController.php`` with the
following content:

```php
<?php
namespace App\Controller;

use App\Controller\AppController;

class CocktailsController extends AppController
{
    public $paginate = [
        'page' => 1,
        'limit' => 10,
        'maxLimit' => 100,
        'fields' => [
            'id', 'name', 'description'
        ],
        'sortWhitelist' => [
            'id', 'name', 'description'
        ]
    ];
}
```

### Generate the entity and table

Generate the required entity and model by running the following command inside
your application's root directory:

```bash
bin/cake bake model Cocktails
```

### Create html views

Even though **your API does not need/use views** to output JSON and XML (that part is handled
for you by the CRUD plugin) we will still generate some html views for easy browsing the cocktails
and to prepare for the follow-up tutorials.

Generate the views by by running the following command inside your application's root directory:

```bash
bin/cake bake template Cocktails
```

If things went well browsing to ``http://cake3api.app/cocktails`` should
display something similar to:

![Cocktails index](/static/images/blog/2015/04/how-to-use-a-cakephp-3-rest-api/browser-cocktails-index.png)

## 2. Accessing API Resources

Your API supports accessing resources with or without extensions and we will
test both where applicable.

If you don't have a client capable of testing Request Headers you might
consider using:

- [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/introduction)
- The [RESTClient](https://addons.mozilla.org/nl/firefox/addon/restclient/) plugin for Firefox
- The [Cocoa REST Client](http://mmattozzi.github.io/cocoa-rest-client/) if you are on a Mac

> **Note:** for brevity we will only test JSON responses.

### Index action (GET)

Retrieve the first JSON page with cocktails from your API by either:

- Retrieving directly from ``http://cake3api.app/cocktails.json``
- Querying ``http://cake3api.app/cocktails`` using:
    - **HTTP Method** ``GET``
    - **Accept Header** ``application/json``

![API Request Headers for index action](/static/images/blog/2015/04/how-to-use-a-cakephp-3-rest-api/api-request-headers-index.png)

Should return Status Code 200 (Success) with a JSON response body similar to:

```json
{
    "success": true,
    "data": [
        {
            "id": 1,
            "name": "Cosmopolitan",
            "description": "Vodka based"
        },
        {
            "id": 2,
            "name": "Margarita",
            "description": "Tequila based"
        },
        {
            "id": 3,
            "name": "Mojito",
            "description": "Rum based"
        }
    ],
    "pagination": {
        "page_count": 5,
        "current_page": 1,
        "has_next_page": true,
        "has_prev_page": false,
        "count": 21,
        "limit": null
    }
}
```

### View action (GET)

Specify a record id to retrieve JSON details for a single cocktail by either:

- Retrieving directly from e.g. ``http://cake3api.app/cocktails/5.json``
- Querying ``http://cake3api.app/cocktails/5`` using:
    - **HTTP Method** ``GET``
    - **Accept Header** ``application/json``

![API Request Headers for view action](/static/images/blog/2015/04/how-to-use-a-cakephp-3-rest-api/api-request-headers-view.png)

Should return Status Code 200 (Success) with a JSON response body similar to:

```json
{
    "success": true,
    "data": {
        "id": 5,
        "name": "Caipirinha",
        "description": "Rum based",
        "created": "2015-04-11T09:33:37+0000",
        "modified": null
    }
}
```

### Add action (POST)

Create a new cocktail record by posting JSON data to your API using:

- The index URL ``http://cake3api.app/cocktails``
- **HTTP Method** ``POST``
- **Accept Header** ``application/json``
- **Content-Type Header** ``application/json``
- Body data in (absolutely) correct JSON format

![API Request Headers for add action](/static/images/blog/2015/04/how-to-use-a-cakephp-3-rest-api/api-request-headers-add.png)

Should return Status Code 201 (Created) with a JSON response body containing
the **id of the created cocktail** similar to:

```json
{
    "success": true,
    "data": {
        "id": 22
    }
}
```

### Edit/Update action (PUT)

Change an existing cocktail by posting JSON data to our API using:

- The view URL for the specific recipe, e.g. ``http://cake3api.app/cocktails/5``
- **HTTP Method** ``PUT``
- **Accept Header** ``application/json``
- **Content-Type Header** ``application/json``
- Partial or full body data in (absolutely) correct JSON format

![API Request Headers for edit/update action](/static/images/blog/2015/04/how-to-use-a-cakephp-3-rest-api/api-request-headers-edit.png)

Should return Status Code 200 (Success) with a JSON response body similar to:

```json
{
    "success": true,
    "data": []
}
```

### Delete action (DELETE)

Delete an existing cocktail through your API by using:

- The view URL for the specific cocktail, e.g. ``http://cake3api.app/cocktails/5``
- **HTTP Method** ``DELETE``
- **Accept Header** ``application/json``

![API Request Headers for delete action](/static/images/blog/2015/04/how-to-use-a-cakephp-3-rest-api/api-request-headers-delete.png)

Should return Status Code 200 (Success) on success with a JSON response body similar to:

```json
{
    "success": true,
    "data": []
}
```

## 3. Configuring Pagination

The Paginator settings in ``src/Controller/CocktailsController.php`` are used
by your API to format the outputted JSON/XML. Let's change some of the settings
below in preparation for querystring parameter testing.

```php
    public $paginate = [
        'page' => 1,
        'limit' => 10,
        'maxLimit' => 100,
        'fields' => [
            'id', 'name', 'description'
        ],
        'sortWhitelist' => [
            'id', 'name', 'description'
        ]
    ];
```

### Show all cocktail details/fields

To show all record details **completely remove** the ``fields`` array (used earlier to
keep the JSON output examples readable).

Querying ``http://cake3api.app/cocktails.json?limit=2`` should now produce
more detailed JSON similar to:

```json
{
    "success": true,
    "data": [
        {
            "id": 1,
            "name": "Cosmopolitan",
            "description": "Vodka based",
            "created": "2015-04-10T15:56:23+0000",
            "modified": null
        },
        {
            "id": 2,
            "name": "Margarita",
            "description": "Tequila based",
            "created": "2015-04-10T15:59:39+0000",
            "modified": null
        }
    ],
    "pagination": {
        "page_count": 11,
        "current_page": 1,
        "has_next_page": true,
        "has_prev_page": false,
        "count": 21,
        "limit": 2
    }
}
```

### Show less cocktails per page

To show only show 5 cocktails per page change ``limit => 10`` to ``limit => 5``.

### Set maximum number of cocktails per page

To never show more than 15 cocktails change ``'maxLimit' => 100`` to
``'maxLimit' => 15``.

### Prevent sorting by description

To prevent users from sorting by the description field remove ``description``
from the ``sortWhitelist`` array.

### Default page

Do NOT change the default ``page`` used for the index resultset to prevent
frustrating further tests.

## 4. Testing Querystring Parameters

Your API comes with support for querystring parameters that clients can use
to manipulate the output produced by your API.

### Limiting results

Clients can use the ``limit`` parameter to manipulate the number of records
returned by your API.

To verify the parameter works as expected query ``http://cake3api.app/cocktails.json?limit=3``.

The result should list three cocktails instead of (the now default) five.

### Rate limiting

To verify your API is respecting the ``maxLimit`` Paginator setting
query ``http://cake3api.app/cocktails.json?limit=20``.

The result should only list 15 cocktails.

### Sorting by field

Clients can use the ``sort`` parameter to specify which field should be used
to sort the results produced by your API.

To verify the parameter is working as expected query
``http://cake3api.app/cocktails.json?sort=name``.

The results should be sorted by cocktail name.

### Sorting ascending/descending

Clients can use the ``direction`` parameter **in combination** with the ``sort``
parameter to specify the direction in which results are sorted by your API
(either ``asc`` or ``desc``).

To verify the parameter is working as expected query
``http://cake3api.app/cocktails.json?sort=name&direction=desc``.

The results should be reverse-sorted by cocktail name.

### Sort whitelist

To verify your API is respecting the ``sortWhitelist`` Paginator setting
query ``http://cake3api.app/cocktails.json?sort=description``.

The result should show the default (non-sorted) index results since we
removed ``description`` from the sortWhitelist array.
