## Create a feature branch:

Create a local feature branch called "tooltips" and add it to the remote repository:

```
git branch -a
git checkout -b tooltips
git push origin tooltips
```

## Develop on the feature branch:

Make sure you are working in the local "tooltips" branch and make some file changes.

```
git branch -a
git status
git commit .
git push origin tooltips
```

## Merge feature branch into master:

**Please note:** Merging should be done from within the local master

```
git checkout master
git diff master tooltips
git merge tooltips
git push origin
```

## Clean up the feature branch:

Once the feature branch is completely merged into the master we can safely remove the local and remote feature branches:

```
git checkout master
git branch -d tooltips
git push origin :tooltips
```
